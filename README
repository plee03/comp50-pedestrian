Pedestrian Model
by: Caitlin Klein and Peter Lee

Files
- proxy.erl: The server that synchronizes and sends the time to person processes 
             and outputs time and location information to a file.
- loader.erl: The loader module for the program. Reads in file input and spawns
              the map server, proxy, and all of the person processes according 
              to the data. 
- map.erl: The module for the map server.
- ugraph.erl: The module representing undirected graphs.
- person.erl: The module representing a person as a process.
- gen_sched.py: Generates random schedule given a graph for use with the program
                above. See below for usage.
- viz.html: Implements a visualization of the output of the pedestrian traffic
            simulation.
- compile: compiles the erl modules


How to Run
    The program can be run by opening up the erlang intepreter and calling 
    loader:start with 3 arguments in this order: a file containing a list of 
    all the file names that are schedules for the persons, a file containing
    the layout of the graph, and a file to the output to.

    For easy generation of files we have written a python script (gen_sched.py)
    to pseudo randomly generate schedules. The filename is the file containing
    the graph information and the interval is how often people move. So if the 
    interval is set to 10, people move every 10 ticks. The people are relentless
    in travelling to a location so if they don't have enough time to get somewhere
    they will skip the next location and continue.
    Usage: gen_sched.py -g filename -n num_scheds -o output_directory -i interval
    
    We have provided graph.txt for ease of use. It can be modified as long as the
    format remains the same. In addition there should be no repeats in vertex names
    or repeats in paths. The graph provided must be connected or behaviour is 
    undefined. 

    EX:
    >sh compile
    >gen_sched.py -g graph.txt -n 100 -o files -i 10
    >erl
    >>>loader:start("files/schedules.txt", "graph.txt", "output.txt").
    >>>ok.
    >>>Done.

Format of Files
    All of the files are formatted to be in erlang terms.
    Graph File:
       vertex_name1. 
       vertex_name2. 
       {vertex_name1, vertex_name2, 3, 5}.

    The graph file contains all the vertices as valid erlang atoms (followed
    by a '.') followed by the edges. The edges are tuples containing the 
    two vertices that are connected, followed by the weight of the edge and
    the capacity of the path in integers.

    Schedules File:
        'sched1.txt'.
        'file3.txt'.
        'ex.txt'.

    The schedules file contains all of the filenames for the different 
    schedules. If the python script is used this is automatically generated. 

    Schedule File:
        {0, vertex_name1}. 
        {10, vertex_name2}. 
        {20, vertex_name1}. 

    The schedule file contains a persons schedule as a bunch of tuples. The
    first number is an integer for when the person has to leave and the second
    is the vertex they will travel to. The vertex is a valid erlang atom
    and must match what is provided in the graph file. The first tuple's time
    is thrown away and the location is used as the starting location. In
    addition because the person uses a dictionary the times do not need to be
    in increasing order.
